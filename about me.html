<h1> About Me</h1>
<br><div>
	<p> Hi my name is Jayla Nakiya Ware, and I am from Carbondale Illinois. I am going into the 10th grade at Carbondale Community High school. I live with my grandparents, and I have a younger sister. My favorite store is a country store down the street from my house called Rural King where I can visit live chickens and get free popcorn. I like to sit on the back of my grandpas black pick up truck and eat ice cream at the dairy queen by my house.</p>
<p> I just got my drivers permit in May, and I love to take my sister to her swimming lessons. My birthday is December first, and my favorite holiday is Christmas. I have a yorkie puppy named Bentley, whos birthday is August 8th. My favorite brand of shoes is Adidas, I used to do gymnastics and ballet.</p>
